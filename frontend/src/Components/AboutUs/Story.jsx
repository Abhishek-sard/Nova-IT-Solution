          NOVA was born from a simple idea: to create a platform where learning
          is accessible, innovative, and practical. We realized that many people
          had the passion to grow but lacked the right guidance and resources.  
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          With this vision, NOVA started as a small initiative with a few
          passionate mentors and learners. Step by step, we grew into a
          community that believes education should not only build careers but
          also inspire creativity, leadership, and confidence.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Today, NOVA offers a variety of courses â€” from web development to AI,
          digital marketing, and beyond. Our mission is to empower learners to
          become innovators, problem solvers, and changemakers in their fields.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The journey has just begun, and the NOVA family continues to grow.  
          Together, we are not only shaping skills but also shaping the future.
